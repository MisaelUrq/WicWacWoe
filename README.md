# WicWacWoe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game for windows, made from scratch.

This is made for learning porposes and it is gone have lots of bugs and weird code.

Made in C++ because it's been a while since I have any done OOP but
don't expect anything to crazy, while I may use templates, I don't
think I will do anything to wierd with them, I hope...

# Build
Right now I'm sure than msvc can compile the code, not sure about
other compilers, you just have to have to run vcvars or open the
visual studio developer command console and run the build.bat file on
the command prompt.

# TODO
This are the stuff I will like to add to the game.

 - Time!!  Like, this is super important
 - Add rectangles and elipses, at least to the basic renderer.
 - Add a audio support.
 - Particles.
 - Bitmaps display. (probably are gone replace all lines/rectangles/elipses)
 - Font rendering.
 - Linux port
