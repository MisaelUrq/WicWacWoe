# WicWacWoe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game for windows, made from scratch.

This is made for learning porposes and it is gone have lots of bugs and weird code.

Made in C++ because it's been a while since I have any done OOP but
don't expect anything to crazy, while I may use templates, I don't
think I will do anything to wierd with them, I hope...
